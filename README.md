# BukWiz
BukWiz is a digital library that aims to make it easier to find and access books. The core functionality of our application is a search system that allows users to find books, a recommendation system, and a checkout system that allows users to reserve books in the library or join a reservation waitlist if the books are already loaned out. These features provide a fine-grained search method and a list of recommendations, allowing for users to quickly find books of interest. The integrated checkout system allows for fast and easy access to books. Other features include BukWiz posts and BukWiz trivia. These features allow users to discuss their thoughts with other patrons and provide a fun competition, both of which encourage interest in the library and strengthen the libraryâ€™s community.
